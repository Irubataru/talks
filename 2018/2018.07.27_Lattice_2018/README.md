## Abstract

Although the general behaviour of the crossover of QCD into the quark-gluon
plasma phase at zero chemical potential is fairly well understood, the question
of what exactly happens to the bound states of the theory in the crossover
region is still not fully answered. In this talk the continuation of the FASTSUM
collaboration's investigation of hadrons in the region of Tc will be presented.
The study has been extended towards lighter quark masses with our anisotropic
Gen2L ensembles with pion masses of 236 MeV. A publicly available extension of
the openQCD software which incorporates anisotropic lattices and stout smearing
among other improvements will also be announced.

## Building

All the tex files must be compiled with xelatex or similar as they make use of
TTF fonts (Fira). Although the tex files for the plots are provided, the data is
not, and hence the precompiled PDF's have been included.

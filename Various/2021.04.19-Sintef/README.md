 * Title: Squeezing water from a stone
 * Subtitle: A brief overview of lattice QCD
 * Date: 19-04-2021

## Abstract

Lattice QCD is the only tool available for physicists wanting to study the
strong force of particle physics from first principles in ordinary situations.
It is the brute force approach to querying nature for answers, but nature does
not reveal its secrets freely. In this talk I will give a short introduction to
the field of lattice QCD, the problems that must be solved, and some clever
approaches developed a large group of researchers over many years for doing so.

## Building

All the tex files must be compiled with xelatex or similar as they make use of
TTF fonts. The talk uses the "Code Course" theme from my
[custom beamer themes](https://github.com/Irubataru/beamer-themes).

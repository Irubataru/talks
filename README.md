# Talks

Talks I have given throughout the years.

They are divided into years, but these also correspond to different phases of my
life:

- 2013 to 2016 when I was a PhD student in Frankfurt
- 2016 to 2018 which were my postdoc years in Swansea
- 2021 to 2024 while I worked as a researcher as SINTEF
- 2024 onwards where I am now primarily a backend developer

## Building

A pre-built PDF is available in every directory. Most folders contain
instructions if necessary for building. In general, almost all of the talks use
my own custom beamer themes. They are available
[on github](https://github.com/Irubataru/custom-beamer-themes).

## Other

* I also gave an introductory lecture to the C++ programming language, which can
  be found [here](https://github.com/Irubataru/cpp-lecture-2015).

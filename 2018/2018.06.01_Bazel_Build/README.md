## Abstract

A good build system is essential for any large scale projects. If set up
properly it makes it easy to compile often, which in turn insentivices active
debugging, frequent unit testing, and making sure all your git commits compile.

My question for this talk is this: If they are such important tools, and have
been around for more than 50 years, why are there no good ones?

In the talk I will highlight some of the things that are important to me and go
through some scenarios I have encountered recently. I will also talk about the
systems I have personally used, systems I have researched, and most importantly,
about bazel, the newest tool in my toolbox and how it solves some of my
grievances (and not others).

# 2018.02.09 - C++ Templates

* Title: Introduction to C++ templates
* Date: 09-02-2018
* Made with beamer

## Abstract

In this talk I will give a thorough introduction to templates in C++. This will
include topics such as: what a template is; what kind of templates are there;
what are the rules for template lookup; when are templates instantiated, and how
can you affect this; what is a template specialisation, and what are the
restrictions. If time permits we will also talk about the "recently" introduced
concept of variadic templates and how these can be used to replace C's infamous
varargs.

The talk is intended to both introduce the rules of templates to the audience,
push the "all errors at compile time"-mindset, as well as build a solid
foundation on which we will base the next talk in the series, which is on
template metaprogramming.

## Building

All the tex files must be compiled with xelatex or similar as they make use of
TTF fonts.

Title:
Smart pointers in C++

Abstract:
Avoiding memory leaks and writing exception safe programs is important if one
wants to save oneself from hours of debugging. Albeit writing "good programs"
with "dumb pointers" is possible, it is tedious and error prone, one can
remedy most of these issues by using resource managing objects.

In this presentation we will look at the smart pointers introduced in C++11
and discuss use guidelines and pitfalls.

# What is Rust?

- Compiled language
- Type safe
- Memory safe
- Manual memory management (_no garbage collection_)

<br/><br/>

## Disclaimer
> I am not an expert, I started learning this language for advent of code 2022,
> and only started using it for work this summer. This is my attempt at an
> introduction to the language, its quirks and features.

# Syntax

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
pub struct Graph {
    pub nodes: Vec<Node>,
    pub edges: Vec<Edge>,
}

impl Graph {
    pub fn is_preferred(&self, e1: &Edge, e2: &Edge) -> bool {
        if e1.cost < e2.cost {
            return true;
        }

        if e2.cost < e1.cost {
            return false;
        }

        self.edges.iter().position(|e| e == e1).expect("Edge 1 not in graph")
            < self.edges.iter().position(|e| e == e2).expect("Edge 2 not in graph")
    }

    pub fn adjacent_edges<'a>(&'a self, node: &'a Node) -> impl Iterator<Item = &'a Edge> {
        self.edges.iter().filter(|&e| e.has_node(*node))
    }
}
```

# Move by default

In Rust, assignments are move by default

- In C++ we have copy by default
- In C# we have reference by default

<!-- stop -->

```rust
let old_owner = String::new();   // ← old_owner owns created resource 
let new_owner = old_owner;       // ← new_owner now owns this resource
println!("{}", &old_owner)       // ←  compile error! borrow after move
```

<!-- stop -->
<br/>Compiling `move.rs`

```
error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `old_owner`
 --> move.rs:4:20
  |
2 |     let old_owner = String::new();
  |         - move occurs because `old_owner` has type `String`,
  |           which does not implement the `Copy` trait
4 |     let new_owner = old_owner;
  |                     - value moved here
5 |     println!("{}", old_owner);
  |                    ^ value borrowed here after move
```

# Mutating variables

Variables in rust are immutable (const) by default

```rust
let str = String::new();
str.push_str("Hello world");
println!("{}", &str);
```

<!-- stop -->

<br/><br/>Compiling `mutate.rs`

```
error[E0596]: cannot borrow `str` as mutable, as it is not declared as mutable
 --> mutate.rs:3:4
  |
2 |    let str = String::new();
  |        --- help: consider changing this to be mutable: `mut str`
3 |    str.push_str("Hello world");
  |    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cannot borrow as mutable
```

# Mutating variables

Variables in rust are immutable (const) by default

```rust
let mut str = String::new();
str.push_str("Hello world");
println!("{}", &str);  // Prints "Hello world"
```

<br/><br/>To mutate them they need to be marked so using the `mut` keyword.

# Borrowing

Taking a reference is called *borrowing*

You cannot mutate a borrowed variable

```rust
let mut a = String::from("Hello");
let b = &a;
a.push_str(" Optimisation!");
println!("{}", b); // Without this it compiles because it checks for future uses
```

<!-- stop -->

<br/>Compiling `mutate_borrow.rs`

```
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `a` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
 --> mutate_borrow.rs:4:5
  |
3 |     let b = &a;
  |             -- immutable borrow occurs here
4 |     a.push_str(" Optimisation!");
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
5 |     println!("{}", b);
  |                    - immutable borrow later used here
```

# Borrowing

Taking a reference is called *borrowing*

You cannot mutate a borrowed variable

```rust
let mut a = String::from("Hello");
let b = &mut a;
a.push_str(" Optimisation!");
println!("{}", b); // Without this it compiles because it checks for future uses
```

<br/>You also cannot borrow a variable as mutable more than once

```
error[E0499]: cannot borrow `a` as mutable more than once at a time
 --> mutate_borrow.rs:4:5
  |
3 |     let b = &mut a;
  |             ------ first mutable borrow occurs here
4 |     a.push_str(" Optimisation!");
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here
5 |     println!("{}", b);
  |                    - first borrow later used here
```

# Structs

Structs are structured data containers as in e.g. C

```rust
struct ChatMessage {
   user: ChatUser,
   timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
   message: String,
}

fn main() {
   let message = ChatMessage {
       user: ChatUser::new(),
       timestamp: Utc::now(),
       message: String::from("Hiya! o/"),
   } 
}
```

# Methods on structs

Although structs contain only data, one can declare methods for the structs,
which as functions that has the struct as its context

```rust
impl ChatMessage {
   
   // Rust has no constructors, but it is common to name them new
   fn new(user: ChatUser, message: String) -> Self {
       Self {
           user: user,
           timestamp: Utc::now(),
           message: message
       } 
   }

   // Reference self as mutable to change struct data 
   fn correct_message(&mut self, new_message: String) {
       self.message = new_message 
   }
}
```

# Enums

Rust has _proper_ enums, i.e. they are not just a set of numbers.

Rust enums can also wrap data.

```rust
enum Thing {
   City(String),
   Prime(u32),
   Colour(u8, u8, u8),
   Dog { name: String, species: DogSpecies }
}

enum DogSpecies {
   Dachs,
   GoldenRetriever,
   ...
}
```

The size of the enum object will then be the size of the option with the largest
sized data.

# Matching on enums

```rust
enum Thing {
   City(String),
   Prime(u32),
   // ...
}

// Matching with the match keyword
fn pretty_print_thing(thing: &Thing) {
    match thing {
        Thing::City(city_name) => println!("You are in {}", city_name),
        Thing::Prime(number) => println!("The prime number is {}", number),
        _ => println!("A thing!"),
    }
}

// Matching with if let
fn get_dog_species(thing: &Thing) -> Option<DogSpecies> {

   if let Thing::Dog { name: _, species} = thing {
       return Some(*species);
   }

   None   // No need for return statement on last line
}
```

# `Option<T>` as "nullable"

Nullable in Rust is implemented as the `Option<T>` enum

```rust
enum Option<T> {
   Some(T),
   None
}
```

<!-- stop -->For instance a `Vec<T>` has a method `first()` 

```rust
impl<T> Vec<T> {
   fn first(&self) -> Option<&T> {
       if self.is_empty() {
           return Option::None; // Can omit Option::
       }

       Option::Some(&self[0]) // Can omit Option::
   } 
}
```

To use these values you need to _match_ on them like other enums.

# `Option<T>` as "nullable"

Nullable in Rust is implemented as the `Option<T>` enum

```rust
enum Option<T> {
   Some(T),
   None
}
```

There is also some helper syntax for transient calls using `?`

```rust
fn add_one_to_opt(value: Option<u8>) -> Option<u8> {
    Some(value? + 1)
}

fn main() {
   let none = add_one_to_opt(None);    // none = None
   let some = add_one_to_opt(Some(8)); // some = Some(9)
}
```

# Exceptions with `Result<T,E>`

Exceptions in Rust are implemented as the `Result<T,E>` enum

```rust
enum Result<T,E> {
   Ok(T),
   Err(E)
}
```

There is no throwing and propagation up the call stack, the errors must always
be handled or passed.

<!-- stop -->
<br/>In addition to matching them as enums they also have helpers to unwrap the
result

```rust
let value = Ok(42);
value.unwrap();                   // panics if value is Err
value.unwrap_or(12);              // returns 12 is value is Err
value.expect("Expect no errors"); // Unwrap with custom error message
```

<!-- stop -->
<br/>There is also some helper syntax for transient calls using `?`

```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let file = File::open("file")?;

    Ok(())
}
```

# Traits

Traits are the closet we come to interfaces in Rust, but they are more akin to
concepts in C++

```rust
trait FormatMessage {
    fn to_message(&self) -> String;
}
```

<!-- stop --><br/>These can then be implemented for your struct

```rust
impl FormatMessage for ChatMessage {
    fn to_message(&self) -> String {
        format!(
            "{}  @{} | {}",
            self.timestamp.time(),
            self.user.username,
            self.message
        )
    }
}
```

# Traits

Traits are the closet we come to interfaces in Rust, but they are more akin to
concepts in C++

```rust
trait FormatMessage {
    fn to_message(&self) -> String;
}
```

<br/>You can also extend any type with this trait, including base
types

```rust
impl FormatMessage for &str {
    fn to_message(&self) -> String {
        String::from(*self)
    }
}

impl FormatMessage for u32 {
    fn to_message(&self) -> String {
        self.to_string()
    }
}

impl FormatMessage for String {
    fn to_message(&self) -> String {
        self.clone()
    }
}
```

# Traits

Traits are the closet we come to interfaces in Rust, but they are more akin to
concepts in C++

```rust
trait FormatMessage {
    fn to_message(&self) -> String;
}
```

None of these have to be defined at the same place in the
code. So you can
- Implement traits for your structs elsewhere
- Extend external structs with new traits

In that sense they are similar to extension methods in C#

# Templates

Templates in rust must be fully specified with respect to type traits

```rust
fn add_message_to_queue<M>(queue: &mut Vec<String>, message: &M)
where
    M: FormatMessage,
{
    queue.push(message.to_message())
}
```

This function can be called with any type `M` that implements the
`FormatMessage` trait

# Lifetime annotations

Sometimes when passing references to functions we need to tell the compiler the
lifetimes of the references passed if it can't be inferred (_it often can_)

```rust
fn say_hello<'lifetime1, 'lifetime2>(
    user1: &'lifetime1 ChatUser,
    user2: &'lifetime2 ChatUser,
) -> ChatMessage<'lifetime1> {
    ChatMessage::new(user1, format!("Hello {}! :3", user2.username))
}
```

<br/>If it's runtime dependent then we have to assume that both borrows has the
longest lifetime of the two

```rust
fn say_hello_to_shortest_user<'lifetime>(
    user1: &'lifetime ChatUser,
    user2: &'lifetime ChatUser,
) -> ChatMessage<'lifetime> {

    if user1.username < user2.username {
        return ChatMessage::new(user1, format!("Hello {}! :3", user2.username))
    } 

    ChatMessage::new(user2, format!("Hello {}! <3", user1.username))
}
```

# Lambdas

Lambdas are similat to other languages, but remember that they also need
ownership and reference specifications

```rust
// A lambda that borrows a str value
let lambda = |x: &str| -> usize { x.len() };

// A lambda that consumes its argument
let lambda = |username: String| -> ChatMessage { ChatMessage::new(username, "") };
```

# Lambdas & type inference

There is also type inference so you don't need to specify the type if it can be
inferred. This is very common in iterator predicates as we will see.

Beware that only one type can be inferred for a single lambda

```rust
let passthrough = |x| x;
let text = passthrough(String::from("Hello world"));
let number = passthrough(42); //  Compile error, only one type can be inferred
```

<!-- stop --><br/>Compiling `lambda.rs`

```
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> 10-lambda.rs:4:30
  |
4 |     let number = passthrough(42); // Compile error, only one type can be inferred
  |                  ----------- ^^- help: try using a conversion method: `.to_string()`
  |                  |           |
  |                  |           expected `String`, found integer
  |                  arguments to this function are incorrect
```

# Closures

Closures work as expected, to make sure the ownership rules are preserved,
function objects implement one of the following traits

- `FnOnce`: Functions that can only be called once because.
- `FnMut`: Functions that mutate its captured values.
- `Fn`: Functions that neither move nor mutate its captured values.

<br/>

## FnOnce

```rust
let mut items = vec![];
let text = String::from("foo");

let closure = || {
    items.push(text);
};

closure();
```

```rust

let closure = || {
    format!("Hello {}", text)
};

# Iterators

Iterators in rust are _lazy_, meaning that they have no effect until called.

```rust
let items = vec!["Hello", "world", "foo", "bar", "baz"];
let value = items
    .iter()
    .filter(|&s| s.len() == 3)
    .map(|&s| s.to_uppercase())
    .reduce(|acc, s| format!("{} - {}", acc, s));
```

They allow the type of chained transformations common in functional programming
/ fluent syntax / ...

# Cargo

Cargo is Rust's build system and package manager.

Most Rust projects user Cargo to handle all these tasks, such as
- Building the project
- Downloading dependencies
- Running tests
- Defining build options and targets
- Composing larger projects

Project settings are defined in `Cargo.toml` at the root of your project

<br/>
```
cargo new [project name]       # Create a new rust project
cargo add [dependency name]    # Add new external dependency
cargo build                    # Build the project
cargo run                      # Run the project executable
cargo test                     # Run all tests in the project
```

# Structuring Rust projects

Some terminology
- A _module_ is a collection of Rust items like functions, structs, traits, ...
- A _crate_ is a compilation unit that results in either a library or an executable
- A _project_ is a collection of crates that can have multiple executables, but at most one library
- A _workspace_ is a collection of projects that usually depend on each other

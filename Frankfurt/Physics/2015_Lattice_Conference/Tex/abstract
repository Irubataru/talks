We discuss the fermionic contribution to a three dimensional effective lattice theory for heavy quarks.
We first study the mathematical structure of higher order contributions of the hopping parameter 
expansion to the effective action. We then examine how to apply a graphical linked cluster expansion to
retrieve analytical results for various lattice quantities such as nucleon number and nucleon binging
energy. The free parameters of the analytic results are temperature, chemical potential and the hopping
parameter. The results are compared to Monte Carlo simulations of the dimensionally reduced theory. Finally
a note on the inclusion of gauge corrections will be given.

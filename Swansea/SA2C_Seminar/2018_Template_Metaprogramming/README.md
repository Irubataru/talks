# 2018 - Template Metaprogramming

 * Title: Introduction to Template Metaprogramming
 * Date: 23-02-2018

## Abstract

In this talk I will give an introduction to template metaprogramming in C++,
focusing on what it is good for and which kind of issues one normally would
choose this particular tool from the C++ toolbox to solve.

We will go through the list of concepts and the terminology commonly in use when
writing metaprograms, and the talk will feature plenty of example, some of which
we will analyse in depth to understand what the compiler is doing. We will also
look at libraries to facilitate working with TMP, more specifically using
boost::mpl. Finally, if time permits we will have a look at how these ideas can
be used to write what is known as "expression templates", which is a variant of
lazy evaluation at compile time.

## Building

All the tex files must be compiled with xelatex or similar as they make use of
TTF fonts.

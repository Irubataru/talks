# Talks

Talks I have given throught the years.

## Building

A pre-built PDF is available in every directory. Most folders contain
instructions if necessary for building. In general, almost all of the talks use
my own custom beamer themes. They are available
[on github](https://github.com/Irubataru/custom-beamer-themes).
 
## Other
 
 * I also gave an introductory lecture to the C++ programming language, which can be found 
   [here](https://github.com/Irubataru/cpp-lecture-2015).

 * My Ph.D. disputation can be found [here](https://github.com/Irubataru/phd-defence).
